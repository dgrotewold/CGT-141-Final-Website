							Toronto is really a breathtaking city. Located just off the shore of Lake Ontario, it has some
							amazing food and a vibrant, diverse culture. It's the largest city in Canada, and is the capita
							of Ontario (for those unfamiliar, Canada is divided into 10 provinces. They're somewhat similar
							to U.S. states in function.) <br /> As far as transportation options go, I used a car to get around,
							but during peak hours it might almost be faster just to walk. One viable way to get around
							is the Toronto subway system, which makes stops all around the city.

						<p>
							The Royal Ontario Museum, known by the locals as just “The ROM,” has some incredible artifacts
							on display. It’s actually one of the largest museums in North America and brings in more than a
							million visitors each year. From the Dawn of Life exhibit, which holds more than 1,000 fossils
							(including an entire Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton!), to artifacts from a variety of ancient
							civilizations, there’s sure to be something for everyone.

							Experience an amazing view of Toronto from the CN Tower! Named after Canadian National,
							the company that built it, and standing at 550m / 1800ft tall, it was actually the tallest
							freestanding structure in the world for over 30 years. After a short elevator ride, the
							observation deck provides a full 360-degree view of the entire city. There’s even a section
							with a glass floor that gives a look straight down, for those unafraid of heights.

						<h1 class="fw-bold"> St Lawrence Market South</h1>
						<p>
							For lunch, I stopped by the St Lawrence Market. At one point, the building was actually
							Toronto's city hall, if you can believe it. The original building was constructed around
							1904, and aside from restorations and renovations, it's the same building. The north building,
							which I hadn't actually visited, was demolished and replaced in the 60s. Inside, there are a
							variety of restaurants and artisanal shops to shop at. If you visit on a Sunday, they even
							have an antique market!

							Hongya Cave honestly felt surreal to walk into. The stacked wooden buildings, the warm
							lantern light, the river right beside it, everything hits you at once. It's definitely
							busy, but there's this cozy, glowing atmosphere that really comes alive at night. I ended
							up wandering through the walkways slowly, stopping to take in the lights and the
							layers of the place. It wasn't what I expected, especially after dark, but that made
							it even better!

						<p>
							Nanshan Mountain's One Tree Observation Deck gives you one of the best views of Chongqing,
							especially at night. Standing there, looking out over the city layered in lights and fog,
							it feels almost endless - like the city is climbing its way up the mountains. I remember
							just leaning on the railing, taking it all in, and feeling how alive the city really is
							from up here. The glow of the streets and the rivers snaking through the skyline made it
							one of those moments you don't forget.

						Riding the Yangtze River Cableway is one of those experiences that really sticks with you. As we lifted off, the city opened up beneath me, the rivers, bridges, and steep hills stretching in every direction. From above, Chongqing's vertical streets and layered neighborhoods
						make so much more sense, and the sheer scale of the city hits you in a way you can't get from the ground. The wind on my face, the occasional splash of river mist, and the views of both Yangtze and Jiaing rivers meeting. It all made me feel like I was floating above a city constantly in
						motion. The ride is short, but especially at night when the lights start to glow, it's an unforgettable experience.

						<p>Visiting the Dazu Rock Carvings felt like stepping into a quieter part of Chongqing's history. Walking through the site, surrounded by cliffs filled with incredibly detailed Buddhist sculptures, I kept finding myself pausing just to take in the craftsmanship.</p>

							The carvings are so intricate and expressive that it's hard to wrap your head around
							how old they really are. There's a calmness to the area too. The trees, soft light, and
							the sound of water nearby that makes the whole experience feel really grounding. It's
							one of those places where you slow down without even meaning to.

						<p>
							I'd heard all about Chongqing hotpot before I came, but it hits differently when you're actually sitting around the boiling pot with family or friends. THere's something about the mix of heat, noise, and shared chaos that makes the whole meal feel more alive. Everyone's reaching
							in at once, trading bites, and laughing through the spice. It felt like one of those moments that ties a trip together.

									If you love spice, this is the place to test your limits. The heat builds quickly,
									and everyone ends up reacting in their own way, which somehow makes the whole thing
									even more fun.
